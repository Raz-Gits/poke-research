"""Per-card feature signals for the Price Lab model.

`compute_features(cards)` turns the raw normalized-card list into a
`{card_id: {feature: value}}` table covering the FEATURES declared in
`pipeline/config.py`.

Two kinds of feature live here:

* **Live** features (`char_premium`, `scarcity`, `months_since_release`,
  `set_rank`) are derived entirely from the free pokemontcg.io data we already
  cache, so they are computed in full below.
* **Stub** features (`demand_pressure`, `grading_intensity`,
  `universal_appeal`) need a paid/scraped feed (eBay / PSA / Google Trends)
  that is not wired yet. Each is implemented as its own one-line function that
  returns a neutral mid-scale value, so the moment a real feed exists you swap
  the body of a single function and nothing else changes.

`pull_cost` is intentionally *not* computed here. It depends on
`pipeline/pullrates.py`, and the contract says `build.py` injects it at build
time (so this module stays importable and self-testable without pullrates).
Use `inject_pull_cost(features, pull_costs)` to merge it in.

Design notes
------------
* `char_premium` ranks a *character* (the card's `base_name`, e.g. "Umbreon")
  on a 0-10 scale using a HYBRID, de-skewed blend: ~70% an INDEPENDENT,
  price-free popularity score and ~30% a reduced-weight price-percentile
  component. The independent block is three price-free signals — total
  printings (reprints = demand), distinct-set breadth, and a rarity-weighted
  chase intensity (how often / how strongly TPC lavishes premium/chase rarities
  on the character) — each log1p-compressed and clean-percentile-ranked across
  base_names. The price block is the clean corpus percentile of the character's
  MEAN market price, folded in at only 30% so popular-but-cheap and
  rare-but-expensive characters both behave sensibly while keeping circularity
  low; unpriced characters get a neutral 0.5 price percentile. The blended score
  is mapped through one final clean percentile to a ~uniform 0-10 distribution
  (mean ~5). The result is a property of the character, so every printing of
  "Charizard" shares the same premium. Covers Pokemon AND Trainers.
* `scarcity` blends rarity-tier rarity (rarer tier => higher) with
  `months_since_release` (older / more out-of-print => higher). It does NOT
  import pull rates — it uses the rarity-tier ordering directly so the module
  stays decoupled from pullrates; pull_cost is the precise pull-economics
  signal and is injected separately.
* `set_rank` is a 0-1 *rarity-tier* percentile within the card's set
  (price-free, non-circular — was a price percentile; see set_rank_table).

Everything is plain stdlib + numpy.
